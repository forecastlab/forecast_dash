We recently added the MLP and RNN benchmark models from the M4 competition, thus completing the suite of M4 benchmark models.
</p>

<h4>Model Definitions</h4>

<p>
The M4 Competitors Guide defined the models as:
<ul>
<li>MLP - A perceptron of a very basic architecture and parameterization (developed in Python using the Scikit library v0.19.1 - available on GitHub)</li>
<li>RNN - A  recurrent  network  of  a  very  basic  architecture  and  parameterization  (developed  in Python using the Keras v2.0.9 and TensorFlow v1.4.0 libraries - available on GitHub)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Our implementations make some adjustments to the original implementations from the M4 competition in order to fix bugs and improve performance.
</p>

<p>
Details of the implementations can be found in this PR <a href="https://github.com/forecastlab/forecast_dash/pull/77">https://github.com/forecastlab/forecast_dash/pull/77</a>.

<h4>Thanks</h4>

<p>
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/rjames6023">Rob James</a> for integrating these models!
