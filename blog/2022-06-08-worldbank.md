<p>
Recently we've expanded our forecasts to cover countries in Asia and Africa by drawing
data from the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>.
</p>

<p>
We have hand selected a handful of countries in each region and are providing forecasts for GDP and Inflation.
</p>

<p>
<a href="/search">View and search all series here.</a>
</p>

<p>
We are looking forward to increasing the number of countries served and broadening
our forecasts to other series of interest.

<h4>Thanks</h4>
